                <h3 class="center">How many beers does it take to put three daughters through college?</h3>
                <p class="about-paragraph center">Our story starts with Mike and Head Brewer, Ty Weaver in a local restaurant in St Petersburg, Florida. They were working on a recipe for a craft beer battered fish and decided to make it with their own hand crafted brews. To them, it was
                    a lot like cooking - you follow a recipe, adjust to taste, and then hope everyone likes the final product. Mike and Ty decided it was pretty good, so they put some on tap. To their surprise, it wasn't just pretty good. It outsold every
                    other beer they had.</p>
                <p class="about-paragraph center">They started brewing more and as the popularity of the beers grew, Mike and Ty decided to try to find a small but more advanced brewing system that would fit in the restaurant. Instead, they came home with an industrial-sized, 30-barrel
                    brewhouse that took up more space than the entire dining room itself. Exasperated, Mike's wife looked at him and asked the all important question: "How many beers do we have to sell to put to our three daughters through college?"</p>
                <p class="center">And so, 3 Daughters Brewing was born, officially opening its doors in St. Petersburg in December of 2013, eventually growing to become what is now one of the largest independent breweries in the state of Florida.</p>

                    Room any time in St. Petersburg, or find us in stores, restaurants and bars throughout Florida and beyond. Wherever you are, we toast to you.</p>
